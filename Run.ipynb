    "# Automatic data analysis and plotting.\n",
    "Update: 14 $^{th}$ August 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "__Notes:__  \n",
    "Tested for the following dgbowl library version:\n",
    "- yadg: 6.1.3\n",
    "- dgpost: 2.3  \n",
    "\n",
    "- The issues with software dependencies in the previous version has been partially fixed. Now, one can pip install yadg, dgpost directly without software conflict. The order of installation matters, yadg must be installed first, fellow by dgpost.\n",
    "\n",
    "- yadg 6.1.3 includes a fix that handle file codec error. We still don't know what caused this issue, but sometime the potentiostat recorded data that cannot be decoded using utf-8 standard. This crashed yadg step in the past. Normally we either have to convert the file into .mpt or re-run the experiment completly. This new version address this issue. \n",
    "\n",
    "### New features in this version\n",
    "- __Show log__: In aa.auto_dgbowl, if show_log=True (in single CPU mode), then all log from terminal will be displayed directly in this Jupyter Notebook. This will allow ease of debugging in case there is a bug with a particular experiment folder. \n",
    "\n",
    "- __clean_temp_dir__: In aa.auto_dgbowl, if clean_temp_dir=Flase, the sliced folder in recipe/data_for_dgbowl which is the actual data folder being submitted to yadg will be preserved. Normally this folder is deleted to avoid cluttering. This option will make debugging to be easier as the recipe files are preserved in that folder. \n",
    "\n",
    "- __Abort dgpost if yadg steps failed__: In this latest version, Autoplot will abort dgpost step if yadg step fails. This will save analysis time and make debudding easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "### __How to use__\n",
    "- Put the files to be analyzed in the Data folder.\n",
    "- Click Run All button. \n",
    "- The processed files will be put in the Output folder. \n",
    "- The exported graph will be placed in Graph_Export folder. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### __If the Run All button cannot be found__\n",
    "1. Select the first cell.\n",
    "2. Control + Enter\n",
    "3. There may be a drop down menu asking Python version, choose Python 3.9. The actual version does not really matter much (This can be Python 3.9.11 or 3.9.16).\n",
    "4. After the first cell is run, the Run All button should appear next to the + Code + Markdown button on the top left corner. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### __Supported experiment type__\n",
    " - __Single experiment__\n",
    "    - With/ without LC data.\n",
    "    - With / without temperature data\n",
    "    - With / without pressure data\n",
    "    - Flow data (with automatic removing of GC injection data points, this help reducing overshooting of FE due to inconsistent flow.)\n",
    "        - Recorded with DryCal software. \n",
    "        - Recorded with the custom Python script.\n",
    "        \n",
    "- __Multiplexing from 2 units and more__\n",
    "    - With / without temperature data\n",
    "    - With / without pressure data\n",
    "    - LC data is supported at this version (provided the LC file is placed directly inside eash unit's folder)\n",
    "    - Automatic flow data slicing and removing GC valve switching and GC injection data points. The flow data has to be recorded using the custom python script. \n",
    "    - Compatible with 1 and more GC folders / flow meter files for one multiplex experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### __Files requirement__\n",
    "- Please refers to an example files for a better idea on how the file naming should be. \n",
    "- **** The naming of the files have to be strictly follow the following convention to ensure the smooth running of the script.\n",
    "- Unless specified otherwise, no space can be used. Please use underscore (_).\n",
    "- Unless specified otherwise (LC data has different format), the date info has to be in the format of yyyymmdd. For example: 20230622.\n",

    "            - This is used to remove the artifact points resulted from GC injection. We found that this usually lead to incorrect FE calculation. By default, the script will remove all flow data recorded within the time windows of 75 seconds before and after the GC injection.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Multiplex experiment__\n",
    "    - Capable of analyzing  multiplex experiment from 2 cells onward.\n",
